## How to contribute to the Amalgam project

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Coosanta17/Amalgam/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Coosanta17/Amalgam/issues/new/choose). Be sure describe it with a clear layout or template.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. If you are using a blank issue make sure to describe in a clear layout and not just a few sentences and a mass of screenshots without context

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* If an issue exists and your patch has fixed it make sure to link it in the PR description so it can be closed.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in an issue and maybe put a basic idea of how you would achieve this

* Do not open a pull request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change and permission from one of the devs, so you don't end up wasting your time. Please make sure that is isn't already being worked on or is clashing with another suggested change or PR.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the pack in the discord server, try to avoid making an issue about it

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Amalgam documentation/wiki?**

* idk i need to figure out how to manage permissions first

Thanks
