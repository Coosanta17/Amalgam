
# The Amalgam


A datapack for Minecraft Java edition 1.19+

### What is the Amalgam?
> the In-between, the grey areas where you are not sure what dimension it is, the Amalgam exists.

An expansion of the relatively boring (no offense Mojang) vanilla game, add more exploration and fighting and satisfied most audiences looking for a better Minecraft without destroying your cpu (and ram).

If someone could rephrase this and add more info that would be good

### Development

There is not much more I can write about in the concept section as the pack is barely complete.

In a nutshell the pack is adding the main biomes from all the dimensions in vanilla Minecraft and amalgamating them together in one dimension. Each "amalgam dimension" will have one boss which will unlock a "sub-dimension", which I am still developing ideas for that.

##### To Do and Done:

  ✔ Create and design main dimension
  
  ▣ Create Biomes *(in progress)*
  
  ✖ Design structures
  
  ✖ Create and design custom loot and items/blocks/weapons
  
  ✖ Create custom Mobs and Bosses
  
  ✖ Create 'Sub-Dimensions'
  
  ✖ Design subdimensions (more detail when I reach this section)
  
  ✖ Bugfixes and updates

##### *this list will be evaluated when I reach each development section or have more ideas or a better plan*
