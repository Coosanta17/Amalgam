
# The Amalgam


A datapack for Minecraft Java edition 1.19+

### What is the Amalgam?
> the In-between, the grey areas where you are not sure what dimension it is, the Amalgam exists.

The goal for this pack is to improve vanilla Minecraft, it is currently just a race for Netherite and power. This pack changes it, it has more options than just one type of armour that is super overpowered and more gameplay than vanilla Minecraft as it is more focused on the construction and exploration aspect of the game, but this can become boring quickly.

If someone could rephrase this and add more info that would be good

### Development

There is not much more I can write about in the concept section as the pack is barely complete.

In a nutshell the pack is adding the main biomes from all the dimensions in vanilla Minecraft and amalgamating them together in one dimension. Each "amalgam dimension" will have one boss which will unlock a "sub-dimension", which I am still developing ideas for that.

##### To Do and Done:

  ✔ Create and design main dimension
  
  ▣ Create Biomes *(in progress)*
  
  ✖ Design structures
  
  ✖ Create and design custom loot and items/blocks/weapons
  
  ✖ Create custom Mobs and Bosses
  
  ✖ Create 'Sub-Dimensions'
  
  ✖ Design subdimensions (more detail when I reach this section)
  
  ✖ Bugfixes and updates

##### *this list will be evaluated when I reach each development section or have more ideas or a better plan*
