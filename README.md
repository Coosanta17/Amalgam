
# The Amalgam


A datapack for Minecraft Java edition 1.19+

### What is the Amalgam?
> the In-between, the grey areas when you are not sure what dimension it is, the Amalgam exists.

An expansion of the relatively boring (no offense Mojang) vanilla game, to add more exploration and fighting, satisfying most audiences looking for a better Minecraft experience without destroying your cpu (and ram).

If someone could rephrase this and add more info that would be good

### Development

There is not much more I can write about in the concept section as the pack is barely complete.

In a nutshell the pack is adding the main biomes from all the dimensions in vanilla Minecraft and amalgamating them together in one dimension. Each "amalgam dimension" will have one boss which will unlock a "sub-dimension", which I am still developing ideas for that.

Development will be very slow because I have things to do and I can only work on it during the school holidays, which is why you should contribute to the project and make my life easier!
